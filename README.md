# SYSC3020LectureNotes
lectures notes -- on the  [wiki](https://github.com/SYSC3020-Winter2016/SYSC3020LectureNotes/wiki "Wiki")

You can fork this project in order to have your own copy of the lecture notes, and make your own edits.
Github doesn't support this very well, so instead you can also just follow this project and I will add you to the organization. You can then contribute here directly.
